Evaluation of a genetic algorithm based image approximation method

Genetic algirithms (GA) offer good approximations to many
problems, where no fast algorithm is known to calculate
the optimal solutions. It models the natural selection,
where each member of a population (called specimen)
represents one possible solution.

GA starts with an initial population, which is a set of
possible solutions (e.g. empty or randomly generated).
In each cycle GA produces new specimens by applying
\emph{mutation} and \emph{crossover} operations on the
existing ones. Then the population is evaluated by
the \emph{selection} operator based on the \emph{fitness}
function.

In this paper a GA-based lossy image compression method is
presented. A number of triangles are used to approximate
a monochromatic image; the position of the triangles are
optimized with GA. The chromosome representation, the
mutation nad crossover operators and different selection
strategies are evaluated. The algorithm is capable to give
recognizable approximation of images in the 150 byte range.
