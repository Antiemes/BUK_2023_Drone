\begin{abstract}

Extensive monitoring plays a key role in environmental protection. This task, however
has many issues to solve, communication and data collection being a difficult one.
This paper focuses to the challenges of observing hard-to-access areas, e.g.
such as forests and wetlands. The performance of the possible solutions for this problem
are compared, focusing to sensor networking and LPWAN technologies, and a drone based solution
will be proposed. The presented method offers a robust, and reliable, yet simple
data collection solution. The hardware and software architecture, the communication protocol
will be described and the estimated performance of the system is analyzed.

\section{Introduction}

Sensor networks consist of nodes with sensing, processing and communication
capabilities. Their main application area is data collection, especially
on large areas or with large number of points. In most applications
the power sources of the devices are batteries, since the mains current
is not an option. As the continuous lifespan of such a network is
preferrably measured in years, but at least in months, the power
budget must be highly optimized.

One of the most promising classic sensor networking applications was monitoring
of remote, nonaccessible areas \cite{corke2010}, such as rainforests
\cite{wark2008, cama2013}, volcanos \cite{werner2006, song2009} or glaciers \cite{martinez2004, martinez2005}.
