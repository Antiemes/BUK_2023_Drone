\begin{abstract}

Extensive monitoring plays a key role in environmental protection. This task, however
has many issues to solve, communication and data collection being a difficult one.
This paper focuses to the challenges of observing hard-to-access areas, e.g.
such as forests and wetlands. The performance of the possible solutions for this problem
are compared, focusing to sensor networking and LPWAN technologies, and a drone based solution
will be proposed. The presented method offers a robust, and reliable, yet simple
data collection solution. The hardware and software architecture, the communication protocol
will be described and the estimated performance of the system is analyzed.

\section{Introduction}

Sensor networks consist of nodes with sensing, processing and communication
capabilities. Their main application area is data collection, especially
on large areas or with large number of points. In most applications
the power sources of the devices are batteries, since the mains current
is not an option. As the continuous lifespan of such a network is
preferrably measured in years, but at least in months, the power
budget must be highly optimized.

One of the most promising classic sensor networking applications was monitoring
of remote, nonaccessible areas \cite{corke2010}, such as rainforests
\cite{wark2008, cama2013}, volcanos \cite{werner2006, song2009} or glaciers \cite{martinez2004, martinez2005}.

\section{The proposed monitoring method}

\subsection{Sensor nodes}

The hardware of the sensor node is based on an Unicomp UCMote Proton B mote.
The base board has an 8-bit ATmega128RFA1 Soc as the main controller. The
microcontroller core is running at 16 MHz, with an approx. 4 mA current
consumption from 3.3 V. The microcontroller has different sleep modes,
and can be stopped from program execution. When stopped, the current consumtion
is reduced to the TODO range. Another important parameter is the wakeup time,
which is in the range of microseconds. The SoC contains a 2.4 GHz radio unit,
that supports the 802.15.4 range standard for low-power low-range communication.
This communication channel is used only during testing for debug purposes only,
for two reasons. First the the 2.4 GHz band is not suitable for the proposed
monitoring system because of the high absorption of. Second, the board has
only a low gain chip antenna connected of the Soc.

The main board contains an additional ATRF212 radio chip, which operates in
the 868 MHz ISM band. This radio chip can be configured to use different
communication speeds from  It is well suited to the proposed system. First, the

The software of the sensor nodes is built around the TinyOS. It is a component
based real-time operating system, especially tailored for low-power
applications. It has support for different types of microcontrollers, radios
and sensors and the uniform interfaces make adding new device drivers and
communication protocols possible.

\cite{vakulya2013}

TinyOS already supported the ATmega128RFA1 SoC with its microcontroller core
and automatically put it in low-power mode, when it has no task to run and no
event to process. The 2.4 GHz radio is also supported and 802.15.4 standard
packets can be sent and received with a simple CSMA/CA MAC protocol. The other
radio chip (ATRF212, 868 MHz) is also supported with the standard CSMA/CA
protocol, although the special low-power mode had to be implemented. To this,
the header, which contains the source address, must be intercepted and the
time-critical background lookup must be processed in parallel with the recetion
of the remainig part if the packet, before the full packet arrives. Based on
the result of the lookup one of the reserved bits of the acknowledgement packet
is set of cleared, signaling the presence or the absence of a pending packet.
